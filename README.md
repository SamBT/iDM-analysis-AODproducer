Repo is still in a "rough" state, just to get going.

Instructions:

Source runOffGridpack2018Pileup.sh, this will create a
CMSSW release area, with all the CMSSW configs inside
the src directory. Then copy the crab_test.py script
inside the src folder, and change the "sampledir"
variable to point to the sample you're making GENSIM
for. Then just submit with CRAB as usual. I think
that should be all but let me know if you run into
trouble. I plan to clean this up and make the instructions
better this weekend when I have some time. Thanks!
